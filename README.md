# The GreatSPN Framework version 3.1

**GreatSPN** (**GR**aphical **E**ditor and **A**nalyzer for **T**imed and **S**tochastic **P**etri **N**ets) 
is a software package for the modeling, validation, and performance evaluation of distributed systems 
using Generalized Stochastic Petri Nets and their colored extension, Stochastic Well-formed Nets. 
The tool provides a friendly framework to experiment with (stochastic) Petri net based modeling techniques. 
It implements efficient analysis algorithms to allow its use on rather complex applications.


## Install GreatSPN

Follow the [instructions](docs/INSTALL.md) on how to install GreatSPN on Linux, macOS or Windows. The provided binaries install a working subset of GreatSPN, which should be enough for most users. The binary installation requires *Graphviz* to be installed. Follow the instuctions on how to install it on your platform.


## Compile GreatSPN from sources

GreatSPN full functionalities (i.e. scripting) are available when it is installed from sources.
Follow the [instructions](docs/COMPILE.md) on how to compile the framework from sources.


## How to run the Graphical User Interface.

If the installation of GreatSPN is successful, the GreatSPN Editor should appear
in the system application menu. 
In case the Editor is built from sources, you can launch it from the command line
with this command:
```
greatspn_editor
```

## How to run the command-line solvers.

When GreatSPN is installed on your PC from sources on Unix-like systems, it will (by default) place itself in the: `/usr/local/GreatSPN` directory. 
The following sub-directories will be created:

 * `${GREATSPN_HOME}/scripts`:  the scripts that invoke the solution pipelines.
 * `${GREATSPN_HOME}/bin`:  the individual solver binaries.
 * `${GREATSPN_HOME}/models`:  the default models available from the GUI.

Typically, most tools are accessed through a script in the first directory.

**TBD**: description of the core tools.
